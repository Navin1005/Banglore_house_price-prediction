# Banglore_house_price-prediction

This project series guides you through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. We begin by constructing a predictive model using sklearn and linear regression, employing the Bangalore home prices dataset obtained from Kaggle.com. Subsequently, we develop a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests using the saved model. Finally, we create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling users to input home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., and retrieving the predicted price by calling the Python Flask server.

#Project Overview
Throughout the project, we cover various data science concepts, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold cross-validation. We utilize a range of technologies and tools, including:

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs
Python Flask for HTTP server
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface (UI)
