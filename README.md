# Banglore_house_price-prediction

This project series guides you through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. We begin by constructing a predictive model using sklearn and linear regression, employing the Bangalore home prices dataset obtained from Kaggle.com. Subsequently, we develop a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests using the saved model. Finally, we create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling users to input home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., and retrieving the predicted price by calling the Python Flask server.

# Project Overview
Throughout the project, we cover various data science concepts, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold cross-validation. We utilize a range of technologies and tools, including:

Data Loading and Cleaning: We start by loading the dataset and performing necessary data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers.

Outlier Detection and Removal: We use techniques such as visualization and statistical methods to identify outliers in the dataset and remove them to ensure the quality of our predictive model.

Feature Engineering: We engineer new features from the existing dataset to improve the predictive power of our model. This involves creating new variables or transforming existing ones to capture meaningful patterns in the data.

Dimensionality Reduction: We apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features while preserving as much information as possible.

Hyperparameter Tuning: We use gridsearchcv to tune the hyperparameters of our machine learning models, optimizing their performance on the validation data.

K-fold Cross-Validation: We implement k-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization performance of our models and ensure they are robust to variations in the training data.

# Technologies and Tools Used
1) Python: We use Python as the primary programming language for data analysis, model building, and web development.
2) Numpy and Pandas: These libraries are utilized for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
3) Matplotlib: We use Matplotlib for data visualization, including plotting histograms, scatter plots, and line graphs.
4) Scikit-learn (Sklearn): Sklearn is our go-to library for machine learning algorithms and model building.
5) Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm: We use these integrated development environments (IDEs) for coding, experimentation, and collaboration.
6) Python Flask: Flask is used to build the HTTP server that serves predictions from our trained model.
7) HTML/CSS/JavaScript: These technologies are employed to develop the user interface (UI) for the real estate price prediction website.
